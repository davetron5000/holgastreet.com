Neighborhoods and is something you immediately notice being in the neighborhood.  None of it is true 'street art', but it adds character to the neighborhood that I always enjoy seeing."

The light was tough, so some of these were taken in 'bulb mode' where the shutter speed is essentially how long I held down my finger on the shutter.  Mixed results, but a few shots I liked!"
